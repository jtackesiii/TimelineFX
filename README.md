# Timeline FX

This is my first JavaFX project, which I hope can be used as an aid for anyone interested in learning via timelines.

TimelineFX is a timeline creation and study tool. Create, view, and edit timelines, and quiz yourself with flash cards.

If you use a Windows machine, free to try it out by downloading [target/TimelineFX.zip](/target/TimelineFX.zip).

## Using the included logo

To use the logo, navigate to /bin/ >> TimelineFX.bat

Right-click, and "create shortcut".

Right-click the shortcut, and click "properties" >> "change icon"

Navigate to /bin/logo.ico and select.

Done!

## Still in development:

1. Enable embedded images
2. Cross-platform deploy
