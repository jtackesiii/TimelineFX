# Timeline FX

This is my first JavaFX project, which I hope can be used as an aid for anyone interested in learning via timelines.

TimelineFX is a timeline creation and study tool. Create, view, and edit timelines, and quiz yourself with flash cards.

If you use a Windows machine, free to try it out by downloading [target/TimelineFX.zip](/target/TimelineFX.zip).

ToDo:

1. Enable Unicode text
2. Enable embedded images
3. Cross-platform deploy
